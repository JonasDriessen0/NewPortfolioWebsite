                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>Ground Zero is a short fast paced shooter game inspired by old shooter like quake and was made within 8 days for the
                <a href="https://itch.io/jam/hyper-unicorn-gamejam-final-chapter" target="_blank" >Hyper Unicorn Game Jam</a>.
                 This project tought me many new things that i previously didnt know and helped me better understand how other games did certain things such as 
                 Making cool enviroments and making them work well with the type of game im making and many more other things.
                </p>

                <h2>Development Process</h2>
                <p>I first heard of the Hyper Unicorn Game Jam through some friends who were going to participate but i was pretty busy around the time that the jam started
                    so i originally didnt plan on participating. However a few days later i saw a few friends talk about and i thought to myself that it wouldnt hurt to try
                    and make a game for this jam. So i made a quick prototype and i started to see some potential in it.
                </p>
                <p>I first began by taking what i learned from making movement for other projects like my <a href="UKPage.html" >Ultrakill vertical slice</a>
                    and <a href="URSPage.html" target="_blank" >Unnamed retro shooter</a> projects and making a simple but fun movement system for the game.
                </p>

                    <source src="img/GZMovement.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                <p>After that i began designing the enemies and levels. I experimented a lot with baked lighting for the first time to really make the enviroments pop a little
                    bit more and to make it more performant than placing tons of realtime lights in the scene. Theres still a lot i could learn about game design but i think
                    that the levels i made all look pretty good!
                </p>

                <img src="img/GZEnvSS3.png" alt="ground zero Image 3">
                <p>The game was almost done but i really felt like it needed a pause menu so i began making exactly that. It was quite a challenge to understand as i
                    had never made a pause menu before. but i managed to make a decent one that doesnt really pause the game itself but does let you tweak the
                    volume of the music and change the mouse sensitivity which were all things playtesters suggested. And those values are saved across the whole game.
                </p>

                <h2>Unity Events</h2>
                <p>This was the first project where i really started to use unity events a lot. I had previously heard of unity events but never really looked into them more
                    but when i did a whole new world opened for me. This project especially proved to me why unity events were so usefull, since i needed to quickly make
                    things work before the time of the game jam ran out i used unity events to easily activate certain things and make certain sequences work.
                </p>
                <p>I ‚ù§ Unity Events</p>

                <img src="img/unityevent2.png" alt="">
                <p>For example the ending scene of the game used a script which let me quickly add new things to a sequence and active them to make a cool ending to the game.
                </p>
                <img src="img/GZUnityEventsSequence.png" alt="">
                <p>Speaking about the ending... it would be a shame not to show off what i personally think is one of the coolest things ive ever made in game dev so far.</p>

                    <source src="img/GZendscene.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>Even though the "final" game is nowhere near perfect i still think i can be very proud of it. I learned so much new things from making this game
                    that i can use to make even better new games and i dont think im done just yet with this game as i would like to eventually apply the feedback ive
                    got from people playing this game to make it better!
                </p>
                <p>Also it won FIRST PLACE in the Hyper unicorn game jam!!! Which im super happy with :)</p>
