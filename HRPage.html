                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>Hollow Reverie is a short linear horror game made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/goedware-game-jam-zero-ui" target="_blank" >Goedware Zero UI Game jam</a>. It takes place
                in an abandoned warehouse of some sort where you have a tablet that displays usefull information and features a sonar and a flash ability to help you along your way.
                You are also being hunted by an unkown creature that has no sight but has amazing hearing so you need to be carefull and quiet in an attempt to survive. 
                I learned a lot of new unity skills throughout this project but i also learned a lot of game design skills while designing the levels.</p> 

                <h2>The Monster</h2>
                <p>I thought id get right into what the most challenging part of this project was: <b>The Monster</b>.</p>
                <img src="img/hrmonster.png" alt="the monster">
                <p>The monster has the appearence of a smoke cloud i chose this because i didnt think that i wouldve been able to make a scary fully animated monster
                in the limited timeframe i before the game jam submissions would end, so i chose this as the player cant really fully figure out
                what it is and the most prominent fear any human has is the fear of the unkown so i think it works pretty well!</p>
                <p>It also definetly helps that the monster makes a terrifying noise when youre near it, see for yourself:</p>
                <video width="800px" height="460px" controls="controls">
                    <source src="img/hrvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                <h2>Monster Behavior</h2>
                <p>To start off, the main way in which the monster behaves is down to either one of these states; Wandering or Hunting.</p>
                <img src="img/hrcode1.png" alt="state code">
                <p>Lets start off with how the wandering state works.</p>
                <p>The wandering state is pretty simple, every 5 seconds (time determined by the wanderTimer variable) it picks a random spot on the navmesh within
                    the wanderRadius to and then goes to it.
                </p>
                <img src="img/hrcode2.png" alt="wandering code">
                <img src="img/hrcode3.png" alt="wandering code">
                <p>Lets get into how the monster switches from wandering to hunting.</p>
                <p>As i mentioned before the monster is blind so it reacts purely to sound. To achieve that i first find all audiosource elements in the scene
                    then i determine the loudest and closest sound within range then at last the monster starts heading towards the previously determined audiosource and
                    adjust the monsters speed based on the audiosources volume and distance from the monster.
                </p>
                <img src="img/hrcode4.png" alt="sound detection code">
                <p>The Hunting state is activated in the <b>DetectSounds</b> function and when activated the <b>Hunt</b> function makes sure to switch back to wandering when it is finished hunting.</p>
                <img src="img/hrcode5.png" alt="hunt code">
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>Making Hollow Reverie learned me a bunch of new usefull skills both in unity, game design and coding. Im very pleased with the end result and if you wondered where i ranked amongst
                    other games in the game jam here are my results!
                </p>
                <img src="img/hrresults.png" alt="jam results">
                <p>Im very proud of how highly rated my game was, 9th place out of a total of 70 games in visuals and audio is super cool!</p>
