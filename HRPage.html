                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>Hollow Reverie is a short linear horror game made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/goedware-game-jam-zero-ui" target="_blank">Goedware Zero UI Game Jam</a>.
                    It takes place in an abandoned warehouse where you have a tablet that displays useful information and features a sonar and a flash ability to help you along
                    your way. You are also being hunted by an unknown creature that has no sight but has excellent hearing, so you need to be careful and quiet in an attempt
                    to survive. I learned a lot of new Unity skills throughout this project, and I also learned a lot of game design skills while designing the levels.</p>
            
                <h2>The Monster</h2>
                <p>I thought I'd get right into what the most challenging part of this project was: <b>The Monster</b>.</p>
                <img src="img/hrmonster.png" alt="the monster">
                <p>The monster has the appearance of a smoke cloud. I chose this because I didn't think that I would have been able to make a scary fully animated monster in
                    the limited timeframe before the game jam submissions would end. So, I chose this as the player can't fully figure out what it is, and the most prominent
                    fear any human has is the fear of the unknown, so I think it works pretty well!</p>
                <p>It also definitely helps that the monster makes a terrifying noise when you're near it. See for yourself:</p>

                    <source src="img/hrvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                <h2>Monster Behavior</h2>
                <p>To start off, the main way in which the monster behaves is down to either one of these states: Wandering or Hunting.</p>
                <img src="img/hrcode1.png" alt="state code">
                <p>Let's start off with how the wandering state works.</p>
                <p>The wandering state is pretty simple. Every 5 seconds (time determined by the wanderTimer variable), it picks a random spot on the navmesh within the
                    wanderRadius and then goes to it.</p>
                <img src="img/hrcode2.png" alt="wandering code">
                <img src="img/hrcode3.png" alt="wandering code">
                <p>Let's get into how the monster switches from wandering to hunting.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, the monster is blind, so it reacts purely to sound. To achieve that, I first find all AudioSource elements in the scene,
                    then determine the loudest and closest sound within range. Finally, the monster starts heading towards the previously determined AudioSource and adjusts
                    its speed based on the AudioSource's volume and distance from the monster.</p>
                <img src="img/hrcode4.png" alt="sound detection code">
                <p>The Hunting state is activated in the <b>DetectSounds</b> function, and when activated, the <b>Hunt</b> function ensures that the monster switches
                    back to wandering when it finishes hunting.</p>
                <img src="img/hrcode5.png" alt="hunt code">
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>Making Hollow Reverie taught me a bunch of new useful skills in Unity, game design, and coding. I'm very pleased with the end result,
                    and if you were wondering where I ranked among other games in the game jam, here are my results!</p>
                <img src="img/hrresults.png" alt="jam results">
                <p>I'm very proud of how highly rated my game wasâ€”9th place out of a total of 70 games in visuals and audio is super cool!</p>
