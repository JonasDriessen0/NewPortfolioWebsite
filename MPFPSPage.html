                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>This project is a passion project of mine that I've been working on on and off for a while now. It's supposed to be a project that allows me to experiment with multiplayer FPS elements while also learning the overall structure of how to make these games.</p>

                <h2>The gameplay</h2>
                <p>The gameplay is suppose to feel fast and responsive. Im sick and tired of first person shooter games that have super long delays before you feel your input being applied so thats what i really want to get right in this game.</p>
                <h2>Movement</h2>
                <p>Right now movement is not as expansive as id like since im going to overhaul it at a later point but in the game currently besides the usual walking running and jumping there is wall-jumping and wall-climbing.</p>

                <h2>Gunplay</h2>
                <p>Gunplay right now is very simple. You just have a few different guns and they all have 100% accuracy to where youy are aiming, i might chnage that in the future since this means player will likely have a huge skill gap but for now i think its really statisfying to shoot guns in my game.</p>

                <h2>First ever multiplayer game</h2>
                <p>This project has been my first project in which i have actually implemented multiplayer, i have made prototypes of games which would be multiplayer games but 
                    ive never actually made them multiplayer before. For this project i decided to use Photon Engine since i heard it was very approachable for people new to 
                    multiplayer. With photon its actually been quite smooth so far but i have noticed that its not really much of a future proof solution for me, its good for when 
                    the game is in development but i do eventually want to switch to a different multiplayer solution.
                </p>
                <h2>Multiplayer Implementations</h2>
                <p>Photon is a pretty simple and easy solution for a multiplayer shooter.</p>
                <p>The objects you want to sync you can just do via a photon transform view, i use this for example to sync my player.</p>

                    <img src="img/photonview.png" alt="Code screenshot">
                </div>
                
                <p>And for syncing certain functions in a script you can use RPC's to tell a remote player what to do. This is an example where i use to apply the force on my players force system 
                    when they are hit with the fan gun.

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>I have a ton of big plans for the future of this game. I want to add a lot more content including character customization and revamping of a lot of the existing systens 
                    so do keep an eye out on this project as this is definitely one of my favorite games ive been working on ever! Also if you want to play there is an online test build always available 
                    you can play it by clicking the button below or downloading the latest build.
